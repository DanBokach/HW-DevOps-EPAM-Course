Find command has flag "-exec" that allows to execute something on file/dirs. There are many ways to execute commands using "-exec" flag, here is man output for this flag:
 Execute  command;  true  if  0  status is returned.  All following
              arguments to find are taken to be arguments to the  command  until
              an  argument consisting of `;' is encountered.  The string `{}' is
              replaced by the current file name being  processed  everywhere  it
              occurs  in  the  arguments  to  the command, not just in arguments
              where it is alone, as in some versions of  find.   Both  of  these
              constructions  might  need to be escaped (with a `\') or quoted to
              protect them from expansion by the shell.  See the  EXAMPLES  sec‐
              tion  for  examples of the use of the -exec option.  The specified
              command is run once for each matched file.  The  command  is  exe‐
              cuted  in the starting directory.   There are unavoidable security
              problems surrounding use of the -exec action; you should  use  the
              -execdir option instead.
Also there is "-delete" flag that allows to delete files.
